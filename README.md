# Sort Photos by Color
9
Small project to test out a KMeans clustering algorithm. <br/>
The goal is to sort a file full of photos into groups based on the most common color in the photos

For this excersize, a number of photos were downloaded from [kaboompics](https://kaboompics.com/gallery?search=&sortby=most+downloaded). These are the photos included in Images_to_Sort.zip

See their [liscence and usage agreement](https://kaboompics.com/page/license-and-faq) which states:
>All photos on Kaboompics can be used for free for commercial and noncommercial use.
